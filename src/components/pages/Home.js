      <p>
        This is the homepage to my react website. I use this website to
        primarily test and learn the framework. The to do list uses JSon
        placeholder to simulate obtaining data from a server which is put into
        the to do list. Users can delete and add tasks which will remain untill
        the page is refreshed{" "}
      </p>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

export default Home;
